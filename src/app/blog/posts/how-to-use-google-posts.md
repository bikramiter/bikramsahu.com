## What Are Google Posts?

Google Posts are short updates that appear directly on your Google Business Profile — the one that shows up on Google Search and Maps when someone searches for your business or related services.

These updates can include:

- Photos
- Offers
- Events
- New products
- Promotions
- CTAs like “Call now” or “Book”

The goal? **Convert searchers into customers by showing that your business is active, trustworthy, and has something valuable to offer.**

Google Posts help you:

- Stay top of mind
- Promote current deals and services
- Show off recent work or testimonials
- Drive immediate action

And here’s the best part: **it’s free** and takes just a few minutes each week.
